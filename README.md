# Description
This code is used to generate the results in Section 5.

# Installation
1. Clone this repository
2. Install Gurobi (https://www.gurobi.com/). Gurobi is a commercial mathematical programming solver. Free academic licenses are available [here](https://www.gurobi.com/academia/academic-program-and-licenses/).
3. Run the Python files

# Results
All detailed results for Tables 5-8 are available in the results folder, while other results are already in thr paper.

# Replicating
1. Run the "portfolio_optimization.py" to generate the results in Section 5.1.
2. Run the "protfolio_optimization_data_driven.py" to generate the results in Section 5.2.

# Support
For support in using this software please contact the author (cyfu@nwpu.edu.cn). Note that the software has been tested on a Windows OS only.
